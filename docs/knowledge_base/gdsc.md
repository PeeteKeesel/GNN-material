> Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer

- https://www.cancerrxgene.org/

> We have characterised 1000 human cancer cell lines and screened them with 100s of compounds.
On this website, you will find drug response data and genomic markers of sensitivity.

- [GDSC Downloads](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/bulk_download)
  - allows access to all of our drug sensitivity data and the genomic datasets used in our analyses.

- the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) Project proposed a comprehensively landscape of drug response of ~â€‰1000 human cancer cell lines to 265 anti-cancer drugs and unveiled crucial oncogenic aberrations related to drug sensitivity [2019, 1]
- pharmacogenomics data developed in human cancer cell lines by the GDSC Project and their corresponding genomic and transcriptomic alterations [2019, 1]
