    - DNA copy number variations for 46,221 genes across 996 cancer cell lines, 
    - DNA methylation ($\beta$-value) for 14,725 CpG islands across 1,029 cancer cell lines, and 
    - expression for 17,737 mRNAs across 1,018 cancer cell lines
- __CCLE__ - Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
  - https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/datasets 
  - aims to accurately characterize the genetic characteristics of cancer cell lines
  - includes 
    - mutation status for 25 oncogenes across 486 cancer cell lines, 
    - DNA copy number variations for 23,316 genes across 1,043 cancer cell lines, and 
    - mRNA expressions for 54,675 mRNAs across 127 cancer cell lines
    - newly released DNA methylation data, 
    - whole genome sequencing data, and 
    - RNA-seq data
- __TCGA__ - The Cancer Genome Atlas
  - https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga 
  - collection of tumors
- __STRING__ - database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions
  - https://string-db.org/cgi/download?sessionId=btJp9QnKRkFH
  - The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations
  - they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases.
