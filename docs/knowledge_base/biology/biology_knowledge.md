## Cell Line 
- a permanently established cell culture that will proliferate indefinitely given appropriate fresh medium and space.
- lines differ from cell strains in that they have escaped the Hayflick limit and become immortalised.
- the culture of cells originated from a primary cell culture

### Cancer Cell Line 
- Cancer cells that keep dividing and growing over time, under certain conditions in a laboratory. 
- Cancer cell lines are used in research to study the biology of cancer and to test cancer treatments.


## Gene Expression
- bezeichnet, wie die genetische Information (eines Gens (Abschnitt der DNA)) zum Ausdruck kommt und in Erscheinung tritt
- also wie der Genotyp eines Organismus oder einer Zelle als Phaenotyp ausgepraegt ist
- Im engeren Sinn wird unter Genexpression die Biosynthese von Proteinen (siehe Proteinbiosynthese) anhand der genetischen Information mitsamt allen dafür nötigen vorangehenden Prozessen verstanden
  - beginnend mit der Transkription als Synthese von RNA.
- Die unterschiedliche Genexpression ist beispielsweise bei (genetisch gleichen) eineiigen Zwillingen eine Ursache des geringfügig verschiedenen Phänotyps
-  is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce end products, protein or non-coding RNA, and ultimately affect a phenotype, as the final effect

## Genotyp
- Gesamtheit der Gene eines Organismus

## Phaenotyp
- Menge aller Merkmale eines Organismus

## Multi-Omics
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics#:~:text=Multiomics%2C%20multi%2Domics%2C%20integrative,it%20is%20sequenced\)%3B%20in)

> Biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple omes.

- omes: genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenomne, ...
- By combining these omes, scientists can analyzse complex biological big data to 
  - find novel associations between biological entities,
  - pipoint relevant biomarkers and 
  - build elaborate markers of disease and physiology


- In parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers.
- For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers)

## Gene-Gene Interaction

> The effect of one gene on a disease modified by another gene or several other genes.

### What are Genes? 

A gene is a basic unit of heredity in a living organism that normally resides in long strands of DNA called chromosomes. Genes are coded instructions that decide what the organism is like, how it behaves in its environment and how it survives. They hold the information to build and maintain an organism’s cells and pass genetic traits to offspring. A gene consists of a long combination of four different nucleotide bases namely adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. All living things depend on genes as they specify all proteins and functional RNA chains.

- Genes are segments of DNA that contain code for a specific protein that functiuons in one or more types of cells in the body
- Genes carry the instructions to make proteins, which do much of the work in our cells.
- Certain gene changes can cause cells to evade normal growth controls and become cancer. 
  - For example, some cancer-causing gene changes increase production of a protein that makes cells grow.

### What are Proteins?

Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They are necessary for building the structural components of the human body, such as muscles and organs. Proteins also determine how the organism looks, how well its body metabolises food or fights infection and sometimes even how it behaves. Proteins are chains of chemical building blocks called amino acids. A protein may contain a few amino acids or it could have several thousands.


## Relationship Between Genes And Proteins

> Genes direct the productions of proteins.

- Gene and protein are two entities found inside the cell. A gene is a piece of DNA made up of nucleotides. Genes are encoded for functional proteins. Proteins serve as a structural, functional, and regulatory component of the cell.
- Most genes contain the information needed to make functional molecules called proteins. (A few genes produce regulatory molecules that help the cell assemble proteins.) The journey from gene to protein is complex and tightly controlled within each cell. It consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.
- Most genes contain the information require to make proteins. 
  - The journey from gene to protein is one that is complex and controlled within each cell and it consists of two major steps – transcription and translation. Together, these two steps are known as gene expression.

__Transcription__: Information stored in a gene’s DNA is transferred to a similar molecule called RNA in the cell nucleus. Although both DNA and RNA are made up of a chain of nucleotide bases, they have slightly different chemical properties. The type of RNA that contains the information needed to make protein is called a messenger RNA or mRNA and it carries the message from the DNA out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm.

__Translation__: This is the second step in the production of proteins and it takes place in the cytoplasm. The mRNA interacts with a specialised complex known as a ribosome that reads the sequence of the mRNA bases. Each sequence has three bases called a codon, which codes for one particular amino acid. A transfer RNA or tRNA assembles the protein, one amino acid at a time. This continues until the ribosome meets a “stop” codon. The characterisation of different proteins can be conducted by Size Exclusion Chromatography as this technique can be used characterise molecular weight, structure and aggregation state.

__Note__: 
- _Can 1 gene make different proteins?_
  - A single gene can produce multiple protein sequences, depending on which exons are included in the mRNA transcript, which carries instructions to the cell's protein-building machinery. 
  - Two different forms of the same protein, known as __isoforms__, can have different, even completely opposite functions
  - Scientists have long known that it's possible for one gene to produce slightly different forms of the same protein by skipping or including certain sequences from the messenger RNA
- _How can we make different proteins from the same gene?_
  - through __gene splicing__
  - Gene splicing is a post-transcriptional modification in which a single gene can code for multiple proteins. 
  - Gene Splicing is done in eukaryotes, prior to mRNA translation, by the differential inclusion or exclusion of regions of pre-mRNA. 
  - Gene splicing is an important source of protein diversity.
- _Can different genes produce the same protein?_
  - It can happen. We expect a duplicated gene to either evolve to a slightly different function or degrade to a pseudogene, but there may be circumstances where this does not happen. Maybe the duplication was so recent in evolutionary history that it just hasn't happened yet.

### Relationship between genes and cell lines

- Genes are segments of DNA that contain code for a specific protein that functiuons in one or more types of cells in the body
- Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain a person's genes
- Genes are contained in chromosomes, which are in the cell nucleus

### The Genetics of Cancer

Cancer is a genetic disease, that is, cancer is caused by certain changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

- The proteins have specific functions and act as messengers for the cell. 
- Each gene must have the correct instructions for making its protein. 
- This allows the protein to perform the correct function for the cell.
- All cancers begin when one or more genes in a cell mutate.
