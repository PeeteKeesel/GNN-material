## Evaluation Metrics

[DeepNC](https://peerj.com/articles/13163/#p-42):
- __MSE__: Mean squared error
- __CI__: Concordance index
  - In order to state whether the order of a predicted value of two random drug-target pairs is identical to the order of the true value, we use the Concordance Index (CI).

[DrugGCN](file:///Users/cwoest/Downloads/mathematics-09-00772%20(5).pdf):
- __RMSE__: Root mean squared error
  - average squared difference between the true and predicted responses
- __PCC__: Pearson correlation coefficient
  - attempts to measure if there is a linear correlation between two variables
- __SCC__: Spearman correlation coefficient
  - SCC between two variables is equivalent to the PCC between the rank values of the two variables
  - assesses whether the two variables are monotonically related
- __NDCG__: Normalized discounted cumulative gain
  - a measure of ranking quality
