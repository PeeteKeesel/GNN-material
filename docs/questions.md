- [ ] How can I pivot such that the rows stay as they were? Cause currently the `pivot_table` method will shrink down such that only unique `CELL_LINE_NAME`'s are as rows. Now the dimension is `(983, 957)`, but before running `pivot_table` it was `(235906, 8)`. I want to have all `235,906` rows also after calling `pivot_table`.
