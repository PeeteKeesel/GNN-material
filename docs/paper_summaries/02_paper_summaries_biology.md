> proposed a deep learning model to predict drug response (DeepDR) based on mutation and expression profiles of a cancer cell or a tumor
- model contains three deep neural networks (DNNs)
  1. a mutation encoder pre-trained using a large pan-cancer dataset (The Cancer Genome Atlas; TCGA) to abstract core representations of high-dimension mutation data,
  2. a pre-trained expression encoder, and
  3. a drug response predictor network integrating the first two subnetworks.
- Input: pair of mutation and expression profiles
- Output: predicts IC50 values of 265 drugs
